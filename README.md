# DuoQueue-Bot
A MogiBot, that is tailored specifically for 2v2, that allows the option to can as a squad.

Please contact me on discord at Fear#4756 if you find any bugs or suggestions.

# How to use

It is the same as a normal mogibot, to what I understand with the following changes

!c @Partner creates a squad with you and the person you tagged, they must do !c @You in order to add your squad to the mogi
This squad will then not be affected by the mogibot's randomizing.

You can also !c as a solo player, with the solo players being randomized to be on a team

Every event is a 2v2 currently, however other formats are intended to be added in the future
